# ANTM

This is a silly little project based on results from the reality TV show America's Next Top Model, my quarantine guilty pleasure.  Written with R, I was able to use the rvest package to scrape the data from Wikipedia and gganimate to create the animation.  After I watch more seasons (currently on 7) I'm going to work on some prediction projects.
